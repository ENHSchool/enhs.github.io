			<h2>THE HISTORY OF <br> ECHAGUE NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL</h2>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>The school is located less than a kilometer away and left side of the Municipal Hall of Echague. It is specifically found  in a portfolio of the old site of the Isabela State University and on its left is the Echague East Central School and Rural Health Unit of Echague.
<br>
<br>
                   The request of parents in the poblacion paved the way to the creation of this school to help parents reduce their expenses in sending their children to Don Mariano Marcos National High School and Ugad High School for their Secondary Education. Hence, the petition of the parents of twelve feeder barangays of the poblacion and through the endorsement of the school authorities from the school level, Division and Regional Offices of the Department of Education with the support of the Local Government Unit, endorsed by former Mayor Virginia C. Babaran, M.D. the school was established in 2001 and began its operation during the school year 2001-2002.
<br>
<br>
               Since then, the school is catering to the secondary education of the youth from San Fabian, Silauan Norte, Silauan Sur, Gucab, Malibago, Castillo, Gumbauan, Taggappan, Soyung, Fugu, Angoluan, Sinnabaran, not to forget to include other barangays like, Tuguegarao, Sto. Domingo, Maligaya, Buneg, and some forest region barangays like Diasan, Busilelao, Madadamian, San Carlos, and San Miguel and other towns in the province (Alicia, Angadanan,San Guillermo, Jones, and even outside the province).
<br>
<br>
               The school was formerly named Ugad High School—San Fabian Annex so that it was served by Ugad HighSchool teachers first, Mr. Ferdinand T. Gonzales, Master Teacher I as Officer In-charge under the leadership of Mrs.Rosita T. Cadauan as Principal I, one regular teacher and three Local School Board teachers. After passing the NQEST Mr. Ferdinand T. Gonzales take over the leadership. Due to thepolicy of the department on reshuffling of school heads, it was then given by a Seconday School Principal IV, the former principal of Don Mariano Marcos National High School of Ipil, Echague Isabela, Ms. Emilia A. Respicio,and in 2016 Mr. Samuel R. Apostol, School Principal III headed the humble school,a former school head of the same school. at present it is now administered by Mrs. Lynie C. Bulos, a former school head of Dona Magdalena Gaffud High School.
<br>
<br>
               The first teachers catered to the educational needs of one hundred sixteen freshmen during its first operation in 2001-2002 housed in four rooms donated by the Isabela State University. Because of the excellent performance of teachers more parents were encouraged to send their children to the school. This contributed to the increase of enrolment every year thereafter. From three sections now thirty-three(JHS) section  and twelve (SHS) with over 1,286 (JHS) and 456 (SHS) students.
<br>
<br>
              Likewise from borrowed rooms, chairs and other facilities, it has now 33 Junior High School classrooms and 12 Senior High School classrooms, an office, a computer room, school clinic and a library. These rooms were donated by stakeholders one of them is Madam Petrona Acosta Furuc Bacud-Lim, Parents Teachers Association, Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Local Government Unit and Provincial Government. These rooms addressed the classroom need of the school. Books, Math, Science equipment were provided by the department aside from computer units by DOST and Department of Education to include chairs and tables.These facilities improved the performance of the school.
<br>
<br>
               The united efforts and unending support of stakeholders, PTA, NGA’s, NGOS’s, and the department all contributed to the attainment of the school’s Vision and Mission in achieving the goals of the department thus, contributed to the successful achievements of the school.
<br>
<br>
                This institution is continuously producing winners in the Area Level, Division, Regional Level and even National and International.
